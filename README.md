Kilt is a definition on how to include additional software inside containers. It was created to run falco in userspace
along other software. It leverages different runtimes to perform modifications to the container

## Definition file

The kilt definition file contains instructions on how to change a container to run additional software alongside the 
original entry point/command. [HOCON](https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/master/HOCON.md) was chosen as the 
configuration format.

There are 2 phases of patching that the definition file covers, build time and run time. Build time is when container 
is not running yet. Run time is well, you get it.

### Variables

* **original.*** - contains information about the original container. See runtime specific documentation for details.
    * **original.entry_point** `str`
    * **original.command** `str`
* **build.entry_point** `List[str]` - new entry point
* **build.command** `List[str]` - new command
* **build.environment_variables** `Dict[str,str]` - will merge environment variables
* **build.mount** - add a filesystem inside the target container. Implementation depends on runtime.
    * **build.mount.name** `str` - Mount name
    * **build.mount.image** `str` - the image that contains the volume of the mount
    * **build.mount.volumes** `List(str)` - List of paths to be mounted on the target image
    * **build.mount.entry_point** `List(str)` - The entry point of the image (needed for patching runtimes)
* **runtime.upload** `List(Dict(str,str))` - add binaries to the running image
    * **runtime.upload[].as** `str` - target path
    * **runtime.upload[].uid** `int` - the user id that will own the file (default: 0)
    * **runtime.upload[].gid** `int` - the group id that will own the file (default: 0)
    * **runtime.upload[].permissions** `int` - permissions for the file (default: 0755)
* **runtime.exec** `List(Dict)` - list of executables to run
    * **runtime.exec[].run** `List(str)` - executable to run
### Example
```
build {
    # concatenated arrays
    entry_point: ["/falco/bin/launcher", "/falco/bin/pdig"] ${?original.entry_point} ${?original.command} ["--"]
    command: ["/falco/usr/bin/falco", "-u", "-c", "/falco/falco.yaml", "--alternate-lua-dir", "/falco/share/lua"]
    environment_variables: {
        "__CW_LOG_GROUP": "FalcoAlerts"
    }
    mount: [
        {
            name: "FalcoDistribution"
            image: "admiral0/falco:latest"
            volumes: ["/falco"]
            entry_point: ["/falco/waitforever"]
        }
    ]
}
```
